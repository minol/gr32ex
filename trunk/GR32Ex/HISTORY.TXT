Graphics32 Patch by Mattias Andersson.

Changes 2003/10/30
==================
o Fixed bug related to the introduced 'border' property of positioned
  layers, which yielded display artefacts (this would for instance happen
  if the child layer of a rubberband layer was significantly downscaled).
  Thanks to Thomas Bauer for reporting about this.
  
Changes 2003/06/21
==================
o TCustomImage32.Changed(const ARect: TRect) will now use control
  coordinates rather than bitmap coordinates;
o Added TCustomImage32.ControlToBitmap method for fixed-point points;
o Changed the internal execution of the PST_DRAW_BITMAP paint stage to 
  only update the clipping rectangle. This will improve performance 
  significantly, especially when a bitmap is scaled using a high quality 
  resampling filter (e.g. Lanczos, Mitchell, Spline).

Changes 2003/06/19
==================
o Added TCustomImage32.Changed(Rgn: HRGN);
o Removed redundant SetBounds method from TCustomPaintBox32;
o Fixed bug occuring when changing ScaleMode in the TImgView component -
  the bitmap was not accurately drawn when it was centered;
o Fixed oddity regarding bitmap stretching/resizing implementation in
  TCustomImage32. Instead of stretching the background bitmap to the 
  control boundaries, it is stretched to the viewport.

Changes 2003/06/18
==================
o Some minor fixes to the previous patch;
o Changed GR32_Layers further:
  - Added TCustomLayer.Border property;
  - TPositionedLayer.SetLocation will exclusively invalidate the
    location rectangle;
  - TRubberBandLayer should not have LOB_NO_UPDATE flag set,
    since this will prevent the layer from being properly redrawn.
o Changed a few more drawing functions for using clipping.

Changes 2003/06/16
==================
o Added TCustomMap.OnAreaChanged event;
o Changed various TBitmap32 drawing functions to trigger the new event;
o Changed TCustomPaintBox32.Paint to account for clipping rectangle;
o Changed TCustomImage32.Changed to only invalidate the area that needs
  to be repainted;
o Changed parts of GR32_Layers to reflect the new behaviour.
