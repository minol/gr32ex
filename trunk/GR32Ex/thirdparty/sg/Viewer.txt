   The Compound Document Viewer is a simple demonstration of the
   CompDoc components. It simply browses through the hierarchical
   storage system in OLE2 structured storage files showing the
   storage and stream names in a outline.

   It will compile under all versions of Delphi (note that to compile
   under Delphi 1 the included OLE2_16.DCU must be available).

   You can find out more about Compound Documents / OLE Structured
   Storage from the excellent book "Inside OLE" (2nd ed.) by Kraig
   Brockschmidt (Microsoft Press) or from the Microsoft Developers
   Network library (via http://microsoft.com/msdn/). Good luck!
